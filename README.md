# GoogleSheetSync
Python code to manage Google Sheets creation, modification, access and sharing in order to provide a way for teachers, connecting remotely, to enter mid-course progress reports for their students. Google documents are automatically generated from their proprietary software, Billware, filled in remotely by staff in their private Google Drive, and the results are synced back to the Billware database. Leveraging Google Drive for this purpose avoided creating and managing a costly web interface and offered an easy way to handle teacher/ student/ staff privacy issues. This process successfully replaced the legacy procedure of sending user generated paper via FedEx to staff and back again to the office for manual import and student notification, saving countless hours and reducing processing times and entry errors.
